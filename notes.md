# JS Intro | Basics

## Variables
- `var`, `let`, and `const` are used to declare variables, each with distinct behaviors and scopes.
- `var` has global scope i.e. variable declared is accessible through the app.
In case the variable is redeclared, it is allowed. <b>[Not at all recommended to use var]</b>
- `let` and `const` has block level scope and cannot be redeclared with-in the scope
- `let` - the values can be modified / reassigned.
- `const` (constant) by definition the variable declared using const cannot have a new value reassigned. [in case of object, the value of object can be modified since it saves the reference of the data, no reassigning is happening in this case]
- By default, the value of a variable that is declared but has not been assigned any value is `undefined`;

- `"use strict"`- This informs/indicates the engine to treat all the JS code as newer version.
There is no scope of writing `"use nostrict"` and things like that to escape from the default behaviour. Once set, it cannot be modified. [Recent engines doesnt even require this since by default its considered to be strict]

## Data types and values

### Primitive Data types
- `number` - represents floating point number value between the range `(2^53 - 1)` and `-(2^53 - 1)`
- `BigInt` - built-in object that represents whole numbers larger than (2^53 - 1)
- `string` - holds/represent character(s) 
- `boolean` - holds either `true` or `false` value
- `null` - Standalone value which reprents emptiness. <i>typeOf value of `null` is `object`</i>
- `undefined` - this represents that a variable is declared but its not assigned with any value. <i>typeOf value of `undefined` is `undefined`</i>
- `symbol` - introduced in ES6 that represents a unique identifier

### Non-Prmiitive(Reference) Data types
- `Objects` - Holds data as key-value pairs
- `Array`- Special type of object. Basically a list of items where index is key and the value is the item at that position in the array.
- `function` - re-usable set of code that performs a designated task.
- `Date` - Another special object used for dealing with data-time data
- `RegExp` - Another special object which
is used to store patterns to match characters/character set in a string;
